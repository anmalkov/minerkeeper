MinerKeeper keeps your miner running and notifies you

It is a console application that constantly monitors your miner and restarts the miner in case he crashed or stopped mining due to any internal errors.
MinerKeeper, if you want, can also inform you about the restart of the miner by sending an e-mail message to your e-mail address.
